# Architecture Decision Records

[![Log4brains ADRs](https://alexsuter.github.io/adr/log4brains/badge.svg)](https://alexsuter.github.io/adr/log4brains/badge.svg)

Use this [link](https://alexsuter.github.io/adr/log4brains) to browse all architecture decision records.

## Development

If not already done, install Log4brains:

```bash
npm install -g log4brains
```

To preview the knowledge base locally, run:

```bash
log4brains preview
```

In preview mode, the Hot Reload feature is enabled: any change you make to a markdown file is applied live in the UI.

To create a new ADR interactively, run:

```bash
log4brains adr new
```

## Usage

This website is automatically updated after a change on the `master` branch of the project's Git repository.
In fact, the developers manage this documentation directly with markdown files located next to their code, so it is more convenient for them to keep it up-to-date.
You can browse the ADRs by using the left menu or the search bar.

The decision process is entirely collaborative and backed by pull requests.
