That way, you can become familiar with the whole project history just by reading its decision log in chronological order.\nMoreover, maintaining this documentation aims at:\n\n- Improving and speeding up the onboarding of a new team member\n- Avoiding blind acceptance/reversal of a past decision (cf [Michael Nygard's famous article on ADRs](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions.html))\n- Formalizing the decision process of the team\n","l4bVersion":"1.0.0-beta.13"},"__N_SSG":true}
